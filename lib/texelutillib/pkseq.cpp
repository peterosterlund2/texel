    // Split up pawn moves. "a2a5" - > "a2a3 a3a4 a4a5". This gives more freedom
    // to later move reordering.

    // For each pawn move, compute bitmask of affected squares, ie all squares
    // between fromSq and toSq.

    // For each non-pawn move, decide if it is possible to make the move without
    // moving any other pieces.
    // - If other non-pawn piece needs to move, insert ExtPkMove to move it.
    //   - If target square conflicts with later move, also generate ExtPkMove
    //     to move the piece back to where it was.
    // - If other pawn needs to move, check if a later move of that pawn can be
    //   moved earlier in the sequence. (add constraint + topological sort)
    //   - If not, check if extra pawn move can be added without conflicting with
    //     existing pawn moves and without making it impossible to reach pawn
    //     goal square.
    // - Split the non-pawn move in several parts, using shortest path data.

    // At end of proof kernel position, if some piece cannot reach its target
    // position, add an ExtPkMove for this piece movement. Then:
    // - Try to add a pawn move before the piece move to make the piece move
    //   possible.
    //   - If this does not work, try to move the piece move earlier in the move
    //      sequence where whatever was blocking its path is not yet in a
    //      blocking position.

    // After each move, test if the king is in check.
    // - If so, generate king evasion move.
    // - If king has nowhere to go, generate move to make space for the king
    //   before the checking move.

    // If a rook cannot reach its target square, check if the other rook can
    // reach it instead.
    // - If so, swap which rook is moved.
    // - If there later is a move of the other rook, that move must be swapped
    //   too.

    // Combine pawn moves into double pawn moves. "a2a3 + a3a4" -> "a2a4"
