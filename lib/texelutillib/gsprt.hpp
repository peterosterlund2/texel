/**
 * Calculates the log-likelihood ratio (llr) for two families of hypotheses:
 *   H0 : The elo is elo0
 *   H1 : The elo is elo1
 * given either win,draw,loss statistics (trinomial model) or
 * game pair statistics (pentanomial model), that is the number of
 * game pairs having result 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 points.
 *
 * Optionally also calculates the llr lower and upper stopping limits
 * from type 1 error frequency (alpha) and type 2 error frequency (beta).
 * A type 1 error means rejecting H0 when it is true.
 * A type 2 error means rejecting H1 when it is true.
 *
 * It might seem more natural to use the hypotheses H0' : "the elo is <= elo0",
 * and H1' : "the elo is >= elo1", since H0 and H1 are typically both false,
 * because it is extremely unlikely that the true elo has a particular exact
 * value (other than 0, which would happen if you test a program against an
 * exact copy of itself). However, H0/H1 has the advantage that the probability
 * of accepting the wrong hypothesis (i.e. the one with the elo farthest away
 * from the true elo) becomes much smaller than alpha/beta when the true elo is
 * far away from elo0/elo1. If H0'/H1' would be used, in the case of elo0=0,
 * elo1=1, true elo=100, the probability of making the wrong conclusion would
 * still be "beta".
